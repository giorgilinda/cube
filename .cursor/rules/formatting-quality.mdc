# Quality Control (Lint & Prettier)

- **Pre-Completion Check**: Before marking a task as "Done," the agent MUST check for existing `.eslintrc` or `.prettierrc` files.
- **Execution**:
  - If a `lint` or `format` script exists in `package.json`, the agent should attempt to run it autonomously (`npm run lint` or `npm run format`).
  - **Self-Correction**: If the agent introduces a linting error, it must fix it before reporting success.
- **Style**:
  - No trailing commas (unless specified in config).
  - Single quotes for strings in TS/JS.
  - 2-space indentation unless the project uses 4.
