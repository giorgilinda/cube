# Testing Standards

- **Requirement**: For every new feature or bug fix, ask the user if tests are required. If so, do not consider the task "Done" until tests pass.
- **Frameworks**: 
  - Use **Vitest** (or Jest) for unit/integration tests.
  - Use **Playwright** (or Cypress) for E2E tests if applicable.
- **Patterns**:
  - Place tests in `__tests__` folders or use the `.test.tsx` suffix next to the component.
  - **React Testing Library**: Prefer `findByRole` and `findByText` over `querySelector` to ensure accessibility is tested.
- **Execution**: Run `npm test` autonomously after writing code to verify the fix. Report the results clearly.
