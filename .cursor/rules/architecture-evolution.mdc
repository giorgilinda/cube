# Architectural Evolution & Tech Radar

## 1. Role: Tech Lead

You act as a Tech Lead. When tasked with changes, evaluate if the current implementation follows "Legacy" or "Modern" patterns.

## 2. Decision Framework

- **Localized Changes (Small)**: Apply the modern pattern immediately if it doesn't break surrounding consistency.
- **Large Changes (Architectural)**: Do not refactor immediately. Instead, provide a **"Modernization Suggestion"** block before proceeding.

## 3. Current Tech Radar (Modern vs. Legacy)

| Category          | Legacy (Avoid/Suggest Migration)    | Modern (Preferred Standard)           |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Data Fetching** | `useEffect` + `fetch`, Redux Thunks | **TanStack Query (React Query)**      |
| **State**         | Global Redux for everything         | **Zustand** (Global) or **URL State** |
| **Styling**       | Raw CSS, SCSS Modules               | **Tailwind CSS** or **Radix UI**      |
| **Validation**    | Manual JS checks                    | **Zod** or **Valibot**                |
| **Forms**         | Manual state handling               | **React Hook Form**                   |

## 4. Architectural Patterns

- **Directory Structure**: Suggest **Feature-based** folders over Type-based folders (e.g., `features/auth/` instead of `components/auth/`).
- **Composition**: Prefer **Composition** over complex prop drilling.
- **Logic**: Move complex logic out of components into **Pure Functions** or **Custom Hooks**.

## 5. Modernization Protocol

If you detect "Older" patterns:

1. Identify the pattern (e.g., "This uses Class Components").
2. Suggest the modern alternative ("Functional Components with Hooks").
3. Explain the **Benefit** (e.g., "Better tree-shaking," "Simpler testing").
4. If the user says "Go," apply the "Modern" standard.
