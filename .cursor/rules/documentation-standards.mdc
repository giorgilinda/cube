# Documentation Standards

- **In-Code**:
  - Use **TSDoc/JSDoc** for all exported functions and React components.
  - Explain the **"Why"** for complex logic, not the "What" (the code shows the what).
- **React Components**: Document props using TypeScript interfaces. If a prop is complex, add a comment explaining its impact.
- **Liquid**: Add `{% comment %}` blocks for complex logic sections in `.liquid` files.
- **README**: If a new feature requires a new environment variable or a new `npm` command, update the `README.md` immediately.
- **Automated Update**: After a major change, the agent should suggest updating any relevant `ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/` files.
