# Liquid Templating Rules

- **Syntax**: Ensure all `{% ... %}` and `{{ ... }}` tags are properly closed.
- **Performance**: Avoid deep nested loops within Liquid. Prefer using `assign` to capture complex logic results early.
- **Integration**: When Liquid is used inside `<script>` tags, ensure you handle potential syntax conflicts (e.g., using `| json` filter for safe variable passing).
- **Commenting**: Use `{% comment %}` for complex logic blocks to explain "Why" rather than "What."
