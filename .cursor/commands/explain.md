# MISSION: DEEP CODE EXPLANATION & MENTORSHIP
Target: {SELECTED_CODE_OR_FILES}

Your goal is to provide a comprehensive, multi-layered explanation of the provided code. Act as a world-class engineering mentor.

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
   - What is the high-level purpose of this code?
   - How does it fit into the broader architecture (referencing `000-precedence.mdc`)?

2. TECHNICAL WALKTHROUGH:
   - **Data Flow**: Track how data enters, is transformed, and exits.
   - **Logic Breakdown**: Explain the specific logic, focusing on **Guard Clauses**, **Hooks**, and complex algorithms.
   - **Dependencies**: List key internal/external imports and why they are used here.

3. THE "WHY" (RATIONALE):
   - Why was it implemented this way? 
   - Identify any specific design patterns used (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Composition).
   - Point out where the code follows (or deviates from) the standards in `typescript-logic.mdc`.

4. INTERACTIVE READINESS:
   - Highlight 2-3 "Interesting Areas" that a developer might want to ask about next.
   - End with: "I'm ready for follow-up questions. Would you like to dive deeper into the state management, the error handling, or the performance implications?"

5. FORMATTING:
   - Use Markdown headers, bold text for variable names, and code snippets for clarity.
